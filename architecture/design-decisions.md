# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: MCP Server Architecture
**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Status**: Proposed

### Context
Need to design a scalable architecture for multi-cloud migration using MCP servers.

### Decision
Use separate MCP servers for each concern:
- Source cloud provider (Alibaba Cloud)
- Data transformation/mapping
- Target cloud code generation (AWS CDK)
- Deployment orchestration

### Consequences
- **Pros**: Clear separation of concerns, reusable components, easier testing
- **Cons**: More complex orchestration, network latency between servers

## ADR-002: Data Format Standardization
**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Status**: Proposed

### Context
Need consistent data format between MCP servers for seamless integration.

### Decision
Use JSON Schema-validated data structures with standardized field names across providers.

### Consequences
- **Pros**: Type safety, validation, easier debugging
- **Cons**: Additional overhead for schema maintenance

## ADR-003: Error Handling Strategy
**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Status**: Proposed

### Context
Migration failures can occur at any stage and need proper rollback mechanisms.

### Decision
Implement checkpoint-based recovery with state persistence at each major step.

### Consequences
- **Pros**: Reliable recovery, partial migration support
- **Cons**: Additional complexity and storage requirements
